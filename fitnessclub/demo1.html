 If you've been practicing and teaching yoga for awhile, chances are good that you've been
 going to a studio. Most teacher trainings take place in a studio wholly dedicated to yoga,
 and advanced practitioners usually seek instruction among other like-minded yogis.
 And yet most Americans will get their first taste of yoga at the YMCA or their 
 neighborhood gym. As the demand for yoga classes grows, so does the demand for teachers,
 and you may find yourself considering employment outside of a yoga studio

 “The relaxation techniques incorporated in yoga can lessen chronic pain, such as lower 
 back pain, arthritis, headaches and carpal tunnel syndrome,”
Yoga’s deep breathing and meditation practices help foster an inner shift from to-do lists,
 kids and spouse’s needs, financial concerns, and relationship struggles to something a
 little bit bigger than the issues you face. Yoga helps relieve stress and declutters 
 the mind, helping you to become more focused.

  Cardio exercise is any exercise that raises your heart rate. Face it our bodies were made
  to move. And we all know that to keep our muscles in shape we need move them. This movement
  makes them stronger and stronger muscles make for a more efficient and healthy body. 
  Your heart is a muscle. Therefore working it makes it stronger. A stronger cardio-vascular
  system means more capillaries delivering more oxygen to cells in your muscles.
  This enables your cells to burn more fat during both exercise and inactivity.
  Cardio exercise simply means that you're doing a rhythmic activity that raises your heart
  rate into your target heart rate zone, the zone where you'll burn the most fat and 
  calories. To count as cardio exercise minutes, you must do the activity for at least
  10 minutes.  
  Some of the many benefits of cardiovascular exercise include:
increased heart muscle strength.
improved cholesterol.
stress reduction.
lowered blood pressure.
mood and self-esteem boost.
weight control.
improved sleep.

Boxing is approximately 80% anaerobic and 20% aerobic, which is why I included interval training 
along with cardio and weight training. This workout combines strength, power, speed, agility 
and quickness all into one to ensure you're a well-balanced fighter.
If you're not looking to become a boxer, you will need all of these things for self defense 
and it can help you become a better athlete in your sport.
Before getting into the actual workout, let me go over the activities and exercises you will
utilize in your workouts.

Boxing is one of those fitness trends that’s almost always in the periphery – never completely 
fading out of sight, but never taking the world by storm (à la Zumba). And while Billy Blanks
 helped introduce the world to a more aerobics-friendly version of kickboxing when he developed
 Tae Bo in the ’90s, cardio kickboxing’s harder, tougher cousin – boxing – remained mostly 
 out of sight.

The proper equipment will do nothing to tone your muscles without the correct weight. To determine
 the proper weight, have a trainer or workout buddy spot you to determine the maximum weight
 you can lift for a single repetition of a given exercise. Aim to lift at least 50 percent
 of your maximum for 12 repetitions. If you can perform 12 repetitions with proper form,
 you're probably not lifting with enough weight. You can add more weight and sets over time
 as your fitness level improves.
 Technology has changed exercise. Fitness equipment manufacturers are constantly innovating new products, and health clubs routinely upgrade to the latest, state-of-the-art equipment that: 
is easier to use and gentler on your body,
can measure your heart rate on monitors built into cardiovascular machines,
can track your workout,
can keep track of how many calories you have burned,
allows you to watch television shows while working out.

Exercise balls allow a wider range of free weight exercises to be performed. They are also known
 as Swiss balls, stability balls, fitness balls, gym balls, sports balls, therapy balls or body 
 balls. They are sometimes confused with medicine balls.
Free weights include dumbbells, barbells, medicine balls, sandbells, and kettlebells. Unlike
 weight machines, they do not constrain users to specific, fixed movements, and therefore 
 require more effort from the individual's stabilizer muscles. It is often argued that free weight 
 exercises are superior for precisely this reason. For example, they are recommended for golf
 players, since golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances, requiring exercises 
 to keep the balance in muscles

 Both steam rooms and saunas will make a person sweat due to the heat The sweating opens up the pores and helps
 cleanse the outer skin.
Warm condensation will help rinse away dirt and dead skin and has been used in the treatment 
of acne.
However, what a steam room also does that a sauna does not is help remove the toxins trapped
 below the skin.
